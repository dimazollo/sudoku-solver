# Sudoku Solver

## Overview

Welcome to the **Sudoku Solver**, a tool designed to solve Sudoku puzzles instead of you. While the solver excels at cracking easy and most medium-level puzzles, please note that there may be cases where certain puzzles remain unsolved due to their complexity or because they may be inherently unsolvable.

## Features

- **User Input**: Seamlessly input the initial conditions of your Sudoku puzzle using our intuitive interface.
- **Automatic Solving**: After setting up the initial conditions, simply click "Solve" to let the solver work its magic and attempt to solve the puzzle for you.
