# Sudoku Solver

## Overview

This project is a Sudoku solver designed to assist with solving Sudoku puzzles. While it handles easy and most of the medium level puzzles effectively, there are certain cases where it might not be able to solve the puzzle, either due to its complexity or because the puzzle itself may be unsolvable.

## Features

- User Input: Enter the initial conditions of the Sudoku puzzle.
- Automatic Solving: Once the initial conditions are set, press “Solve” to attempt solving the puzzle.
